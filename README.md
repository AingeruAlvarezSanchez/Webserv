                This project aims to create a web server like Nginx or Apache. This web server will be capable
                of handling different configuration files using sockets and CGI.

                <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for
                communication on the World Wide Web. It is the foundation of data communication for the web, and it enables
                the transfer of data between a server and a client.<br><br>
                <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> works by defining a set of rules for the data
                transmission between server and client. When the client, such as a web browser, asks for a resource from a
                server, the client sends the <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> request to the server.
                The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which contains the requested resource.<br><br>
                <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> requests and responses are composed of a set of headers
                and an optional message body. The headers contain information about the request or response, such as the type
                of data being transferred or the length of the data. The message body contains the actual data being transferred,
                such as the <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTML</abbr> content of a webpage.<br><br>
                <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> also defines a set of request methods, such as GET,
                POST, PUT, and DELETE, which define the actions that can be performed on a resource. For example, a GET
                request is used to retrieve a resource, while a POST request is used to submit data to a server.
